The list below isn't meant to be exclusive, it's more so a collection of links that have helped me out along the way (and can hopefully help you). As you'll see, I've focused on JavaScript, React, and Node.js. There is also a wealth of information on interview prep and applying to jobs.

More free resources can be found on codeburst.io

Software Developer Success Stories
Success Stories
18 months ago I didn’t know how to code, I’m now a self-taught programmer who’s made apps for the NBA, NHL, and schools like Purdue, Notre Dame, Alabama and Clemson. I’m now releasing my software under the MIT license for anyone’s use — AMA!
Last year I was unemployed and miserable. Using this sub and resources, I've been full time employed for a year. I did it with all free resources. I wanna share with you how I did it. (IOS)
I began teaching myself to code a year ago. I got hired at my first job 4 months ago. Here is a breakdown of somethings I was not ready for (FYI job is remote ruby/rails dev)
I'm 32 years old, and just started my first full-time job as a developer. One year ago my programming knowledge was basically nil. Everything I learned, I found via /r/learnprogramming, so just wanted to share my experience.
From zero to software developer - Not really a success story, but a lot of redditors share how they learned. Great for beginners with no path
